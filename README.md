# Logistic Regression Classifier

## Overview
This project involves implementing logistic regression for binary classification tasks. The notebook explores both non-regularized and regularized logistic regression, using provided datasets to predict outcomes and visualize decision boundaries. Advanced concepts like regularization and polynomial feature expansion are covered.

---

## Features
- **Non-Regularized Logistic Regression:** Implements logistic regression without regularization to explore basic classification.
- **Regularized Logistic Regression:** Utilizes regularization techniques to avoid overfitting and balance bias-variance tradeoff.
- **Visualization:** Plots data points and decision boundaries for both regularized and non-regularized approaches.
- **Performance Metrics:** Computes metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model.
- **Exploration:** Experimented with polynomial feature expansion and different learning rates.
